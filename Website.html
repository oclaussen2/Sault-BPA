      <h3>ABOUT</h3>
      <p>Hey, we're Stage Fright – a rock band made up of four friends who are just trying to make something real. I'm Erik, I play guitar, and with me are Edmund on drums, Nana on bass, and Teddy on vocals. We started this band to escape the ordinary and create something loud, raw, and totally honest. We’re all about that raw, high-energy rock sound – a mix of gritty guitar riffs, pounding drums, and lyrics that speak to the messy, real side of life. We may still be figuring things out, but every show, every song, feels like we're getting closer to something special. So if you enjoy a good rock session stay tuned for our next concert! &nbsp;</p>
